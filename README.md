# BEST EVER ME Project 2017

This repository contains code and information for a third-year undergraduate project for the final year project of Software Development (Level 7) at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics. 
The project supervisor is [Martin Kenirons](https://github.com/mkenirons).

TODO: REFORMULATE INTRODUCTION

## Project Overview
The project is a prototype requested to [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie) by [Best Ever Me](http://www.gmit.ie). Its target is to be an app that provides a reverse auction mechanism for beauty services offered by the clients (salons) of Best Ever Me. Users will download app and register for usage. Salons will use the same app as a service provider.

## Architecture
The application is written using the [MEAN](http://mean.io/) stack. MEAN is a framework for an easy starting point with MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and AngularJS based applications. It is designed to give a quick and organized way to start developing MEAN based web apps with useful modules like Mongoose and Passport pre-bundled and configured. It mainly tries to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.

[MEAN](http://mean.io/) stands for: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/),[Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/).

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) takes care of the persistence, providing a document store database where information about customers, salons and bookings will be stored.

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. 

[AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/) lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop. It s a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries. Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs.

Once the application is running, it can be accessed by pointing your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8100/ .
